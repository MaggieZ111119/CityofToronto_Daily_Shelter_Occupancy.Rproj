How can I graph the changes in avg utilization over years?

ChatGPT
You can visualize the average utilization rate over the years using ggplot2:
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(annual_utilization, aes(x = year, y = avg_utilization_rate, color = shelter_city)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Change in Shelter Utilization Rate by City (2017-2020)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Utilization Rate",
       color = "City") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100))  # Convert to percentage

  north_york_data %>% mutate(shelter_city = "North York"),
  scarborough_data %>% mutate(shelter_city = "Scarborough"),
  etobicoke_data %>% mutate(shelter_city = "Etobicoke")
)

# Extract year from occupancy_date
combined_data <- combined_data %>%
  mutate(year = year(occupancy_date),
         month = month(occupancy_date))

# Calculate average utilization rate by year and city
annual_utilization <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(year, month, shelter_city) %>%
  summarise(avg_utilization_rate = mean(utilization_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')


ggplot(annual_utilization, aes(x = interaction(year, month, sep = "-"), y = avg_utilization_rate, color = shelter_city)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +

I want it to be in seasonal(every 3 month), but not montly

ChatGPT
To modify your code to calculate the average utilization rate on a seasonal basis (every three months) rather than monthly, you can adjust the `mutate` step where you extract the month. Specifically, you will create a new variable that represents the season. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Create a seasonal variable** that categorizes each month into one of the four seasons.
2. **Group by year and season** instead of year and month.

Here’s the updated code:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)

# Calculate utilization rate by city
toronto_data <- toronto_data %>%
  mutate(utilization_rate = total_occupancy / total_capacity)

north_york_data <- north_york_data %>%
  mutate(utilization_rate = total_occupancy / total_capacity)

scarborough_data <- scarborough_data %>%
  mutate(utilization_rate = total_occupancy / total_capacity)

etobicoke_data <- etobicoke_data %>%
  mutate(utilization_rate = total_occupancy / total_capacity)

# Combine all city datasets
combined_data <- bind_rows(
  toronto_data %>% mutate(shelter_city = "Toronto"),
  north_york_data %>% mutate(shelter_city = "North York"),
  scarborough_data %>% mutate(shelter_city = "Scarborough"),
  etobicoke_data %>% mutate(shelter_city = "Etobicoke")
)

# Extract year and season from occupancy_date
combined_data <- combined_data %>%
  mutate(year = year(occupancy_date),
         month = month(occupancy_date),
         season = case_when(
           month %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "Winter",
           month %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Spring",
           month %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Summer",
           month %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "Fall"
         ))

# Calculate average utilization rate by year and season
annual_utilization <- combined_data %>%
  group_by(year, season, shelter_city) %>%
  summarise(avg_utilization_rate = mean(utilization_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Create a seasonal plot
ggplot(annual_utilization, aes(x = interaction(year, season, sep = "-"), 
                                y = avg_utilization_rate, 
                                color = shelter_city)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Year-Season",
       y = "Average Utilization Rate",
       color = "City",
       caption = "Utilization Rate Average Change on All Shelters by City") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(scale = 1))  # Adjust scale as needed
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Seasonal Variable**: Created a `season` variable that categorizes months into Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall using `case_when()`.
2. **Grouping**: Changed the `group_by` statement to group by `year` and `season` instead of `year` and `month`.
3. **X-Axis Label**: Updated the `interaction` in `ggplot` to reflect the new seasonal data (Year-Season).

Now, the plot will show average utilization rates aggregated every three months, reflecting seasonal variations. Adjust any specific details as needed for your analysis or visual preferences!

How can I revised Code to Add Total Column to existing table?

ChatGPT
Here’s how you can correctly calculate the totals and ensure everything works smoothly:

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)

# Count the number of observations by city and sector
city_sector_breakdown <- shelter_data %>%
  group_by(shelter_city, sector) %>%
  count() %>%
  spread(key = sector, value = n, fill = 0)

# Check if the total is being calculated correctly
city_sector_breakdown <- city_sector_breakdown %>%
  mutate(Total = rowSums(select(., where(is.numeric)), na.rm = TRUE))

# Display the table with correct formatting
city_sector_breakdown %>%
  kable(caption = "Number of Observations by City and Sector, including all sectors (with 0 if not applicable)")

### Descriptive Statistics for Homeless Shelter Occupancy by City

| City         | Average Occupancy | Max Occupancy | Min Occupancy | Average Capacity | Max Capacity | Min Capacity |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Toronto      | 5443.38           | 6803          | 3001          | 6042.49          | 7241         | 4460         |
| North York   | 64.51             | 73            | 20            | 67.36            | 73           | 32           |
| Scarborough  | 159.59            | 564           | 60            | 178.19           | 577          | 67           |
| Etobicoke    | 48.07             | 53            | 20            | 50.81            | 53           | 33           |

These statistics provide a comprehensive overview of shelter occupancy across different cities, highlighting variations in usage and capacity. 

- **Toronto** has a significantly higher average occupancy compared to the other cities, reflecting its larger shelter capacity and demand for services. The maximum occupancy in Toronto also stands out, indicating peak usage levels that may require further investigation regarding service availability and resource allocation.

- **North York** and **Etobicoke** exhibit much lower occupancy rates, suggesting either less demand for shelter services or potentially fewer available resources. Their maximum occupancies are also notably lower than those in Toronto, which could indicate limitations in the capacity to accommodate homeless individuals.

- **Scarborough** shows moderate occupancy levels compared to the others. The average occupancy is significantly higher than that of North York and Etobicoke but lower than Toronto. The capacity statistics suggest that Scarborough shelters might be nearing their limits at times, highlighting a need for monitoring.

Overall, these statistics underline the disparities in shelter usage and availability among cities, emphasizing the need for tailored resource allocation and strategic planning to address the varying demands in different areas. This information can inform stakeholders about where additional support may be necessary and where existing resources are being optimally utilized.

|-------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Toronto     | 5443.38            | 6803          | 3001          | 6042.49           | 7241         | 4460         |
| North York  | 64.51              | 73            | 20            | 67.36             | 73           | 32           |
| Scarborough | 159.59             | 564           | 60            | 178.19            | 577          | 67           |
| Etobicoke   | 48.07              | 53            | 20            | 50.81             | 53           | 33           |

The data indicates significant variations in shelter occupancy and capacity across the cities. Notably, Toronto has the highest average occupancy (5443.38) and maximum occupancy (6803), suggesting a greater demand for shelter services in this area compared to the other cities. In contrast, Etobicoke shows the lowest average occupancy (48.07), reflecting a relatively lower utilization of its shelter capacity.

Average capacity figures further illustrate these trends, with Toronto's average capacity being substantially higher (6042.49) than that of the other cities, indicating a greater infrastructure dedicated to accommodating the homeless population. This capacity allows Toronto to manage larger numbers during peak times, as evidenced by its maximum occupancy statistics.

In summary, the table highlights the varying needs for homeless shelter resources across different cities, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions based on occupancy and capacity metrics. For a more detailed view of the data, see Table [Table I give you].

How to does to write code for dataset which I want to calculate each sector by location and date?

ChatGPT

You can use the group_by() function to group the data and then summarize the total occupancy and capacity for each group.
r
Copy code
# Aggregate data by city, date, and sector
aggregated_data <- shelter_data %>%
  group_by(date, location, sector) %>%
  summarize(
    total_occupancy = sum(occupancy, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_capacity = sum(capacity, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'  # This prevents grouped data frames
  )

# Print the aggregated data
print(aggregated_data)
